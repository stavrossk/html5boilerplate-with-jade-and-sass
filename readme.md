#About
This boilerplate uses the [html5 Boilerplate 3.0.2](http://html5boilerplate.com/) [updated 19 Feb 2012].

- The sass/style.sass is written in [sass](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html) and it is compiled to [style.css](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/css/main.css). Access the sass folder for the codes.
- The index.jade file is written in [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and it is compiled to [index.html](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html).

Run `watch make` in the command line to [run the makefile](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade#example-makefile) and compile index.jade into index.html.
